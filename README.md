## Required steps to run the code

In order to run this code, you will first need to create two .env files in the root folder. These files will be used by Dotenv to establish the connections with the correct databases. There is an example file /env-example, which shows the correct format required in the .env files. Make sure you link the correct databases to the correct .env files.

```
.env.test
.env.development
```

At this point you will need to run the `npm install` in your terminal to install dependencies and devDependencies.

```
npm install
```
